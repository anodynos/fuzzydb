  General idea is to make the release lifecycle work using maven
  
  It's a good idea to start here, where the difference between inheritance (referring to parent) 
  and an aggregation is defined (see http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/branches/maven-2.1.x/pom.xml
  for an example - this is an aggregator that refers to a parent).

Cooking a release
=================  
  
  Currently working on this, based on what's written at http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-releasing.html
  
  "svn" needs to be on the command line path (which is a pain, given Eclipse has various providers... )
