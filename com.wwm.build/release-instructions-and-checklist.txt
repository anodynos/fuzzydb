  General idea is to make the release lifecycle work using maven
  
  It's a good idea to start here, where the difference between inheritance (referring to parent) 
  and an aggregation is defined (see http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/maven/components/branches/maven-2.1.x/pom.xml
  for an example - this is an aggregator that refers to a parent).

Cooking a release
=================  


Deploying a snapshot to public repository
=========================================
Ensure you have "maven" checked out at same directory level as trunk projects (i.e. in same dir as com.wwm.build)
In com.wwm.build, run "mvn deploy -Pstaging,release" (check parent pom for what these do).

This should deploy snapshots to maven/snapshots dir

If happy with these, commit them to SVN to make them publicly available.

(To attempt to do this in one go, try "mvn deploy -Psourceforge,release"
